This project focuses on automated essay grading using machine learning, leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques and predictive modeling. The primary algorithm implemented is:

XGBoost Regressor â€“ A powerful and efficient gradient boosting technique designed for regression tasks. It enhances prediction accuracy by optimizing decision trees and minimizing errors iteratively.
The project begins by preprocessing textual data using tokenization and vectorization to convert essays into numerical representations. The model is then trained to predict grades based on essay features, ensuring a data-driven approach to grading. Performance is evaluated using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) metric, providing a reliable measure of prediction accuracy. By integrating machine learning, this system aims to offer a scalable, objective, and consistent method for evaluating written content.
